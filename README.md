##Sentiment and Hate Speech Detection Using Big Data Tools
#Overview
This project focuses on analyzing text outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) to classify sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) and detect hate speech or offensive language. By leveraging Apache Spark ML and AWS S3, the project demonstrates a scalable and efficient pipeline for processing large-scale datasets. The goal is to provide actionable insights into the ethical and safe deployment of AI-generated content.

Technologies Used
Google Colab: For running the Jupyter Notebook and visualizing results.
AWS S3: Provides distributed storage for the datasets used in training and testing.
Apache Spark ML: Used for distributed machine learning training and inference.
Python: Core language for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Data Sources
The datasets used in this project are publicly available and stored in AWS S3:

Sentiment Analysis Dataset: For training the sentiment classification model.
Hate Speech and Offensive Language Dataset: For training the hate speech detection model.
Features
Sentiment classification into positive, neutral, and negative categories.
Detection of offensive or abusive language in textual data.
Scalable pipeline leveraging Big Data tools for efficient processing.


#Setup and Running the Project
Prerequisites
Google Colab account (free-tier suffices).
Python installed locally if running the notebook outside Colab.
No need to configure AWS credentials; the datasets are publicly accessible.
Instructions
Download the Project:

Clone the repository or download the files manually:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

Upload the Sentiment_Hate_Spark.ipynb notebook to Google Colab.
Run the Notebook:

Execute all the cells sequentially. The notebook is self-contained, and all dependencies are handled in Colab.
View Results:

Sentiment and hate speech classification results will be displayed in the notebook output cells.
Visualizations, metrics (accuracy, F1 score), and insights will also be provided.
