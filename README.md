# Sentiment and Hate Speech Detection Using Big Data Tools

## Overview
This project analyzes text outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) to classify sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) and detect hate speech or offensive language. Leveraging **Apache Spark ML** and **AWS S3**, the pipeline demonstrates scalable and efficient processing of large-scale datasets. The goal is to provide insights into the ethical and safe deployment of AI-generated content.

## Technologies Used
- **Google Colab**: For running the Jupyter Notebook and visualizing results.
- **AWS S3**: Publicly accessible storage for datasets used in training and testing.
- **Apache Spark ML**: Distributed machine learning for processing and inference.
- **Python**: Core language for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Data Sources
The datasets used in this project are publicly available:
1. **Sentiment Analysis Dataset**: Used for training the sentiment classification model.
2. **Hate Speech and Offensive Language Dataset**: Used for training the hate speech detection model.

Both datasets are stored in a publicly accessible AWS S3 bucket.

## Features
- **Sentiment Classification**: Detects positive, neutral, and negative sentiment.
- **Hate Speech Detection**: Identifies abusive or offensive content.
- **Scalable Pipeline**: Utilizes Big Data tools for efficient processing.

## Setup and Running the Project

### Prerequisites
- **Google Colab**: Recommended for running the notebook.
- **Python**: Required only if running the notebook locally.
- **No AWS Configuration Required**: Datasets are publicly accessible.

### Steps to Run
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
