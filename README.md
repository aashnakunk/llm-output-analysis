# Sentiment and Hate Speech Detection Using Big Data Tools

## Overview
This project leverages **Apache Spark ML** and **AWS S3** to classify sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) and detect hate speech or offensive language. It demonstrates scalable and efficient processing of large datasets while offering insights into the ethical deployment of AI-generated content.

## Features
- **Sentiment Classification**: Detects positive, neutral, and negative sentiment.
- **Hate Speech Detection**: Identifies abusive or offensive content.
- **Scalable Pipeline**: Uses Big Data tools for distributed processing and inference.

## Technologies Used
- **Google Colab/JupyterHub**: Interactive environment for running and visualizing the pipeline.
- **AWS S3**: Publicly accessible storage for training and testing datasets.
- **Apache Spark ML**: Distributed machine learning for processing large-scale data.
- **Python**: Core language for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Datasets
The datasets used in this project are publicly accessible via AWS S3:
1. **Sentiment Analysis Dataset**: For training the sentiment classification model.
2. **Hate Speech and Offensive Language Dataset**: For training the hate speech detection model.

No manual dataset uploads are needed. These datasets are pre-configured in the project.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the code files.
2. Open the provided notebook in **Google Colab**, **JupyterHub**, or any interactive notebook environment.
3. No additional setup is required. The datasets are publicly available via AWS S3, and credentials are pre-configured in the code.
4. Simply run the notebook cells to execute the pipeline and view results.
